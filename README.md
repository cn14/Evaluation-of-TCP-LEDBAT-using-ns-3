**Overview**<br/>
Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LED-BAT) is a novel one-way delay Internet congestion control
algorithm developed to react to congestion earlier than any of the loss-based TCP congestion control algorithms (e.g. TCP-
NewReno). A LEDBAT source quickly reduces its sending rate when the queue delay experienced in its path is greater than
a fixed pre-defined target value.
